# [fitness-tracker](https://polysnack-fitness-track.herokuapp.com/)

## Description
This fitness tracking application uses NoSQL database MongoDB to keep track of user's workouts created, updated, and queried by unique id. NoSQL data objects are managed through Mongoose's npm library--an especially useful tool in storing information that will vary in its structure depending on users and workouts. The deployed application's database connects through the MongoDB Atlas service. 


## Installation
```npm install ```
